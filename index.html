      <h4>Pixel art doesn't have to signify nostalgia and some retro games don't use pixel art, like Shadow Complex, New Super Mario Bros. and Nintendo's original titles like Mario Maker and NES Remix which use 80s pixel art in a brand-new context.

      </h3>
      <span class="x-education-date">
      </span>
      <h4>Pixel art games don't age visually and will still look good in the future, because the blocky pixels are coarse enough to examine the visual structure directly and lack illusion that can become compromised over time, as seen in games like Passage and Proteus which still look interesting and striking even after several years, and the original 8-bit Super Mario which becomes more iconic with age.

      <h4>Pixel art, being video games' defining visual style, will remain even if it might not push the limits of technology and its future is uncertain, but developers aren't concerned about players that don't appreciate the art as it's subjective and they focus on pleasing those who do.

            <h3>Pixel Art of Spiderman
            </h3>
            <p> Pixel art of Spiderman refers to a style of digital art that involves creating graphics using square-shaped pixels, often to represent iconic characters or scenes. In the case of Spiderman, this style of art often portrays the superhero in his recognizable red and blue suit, with a white spider emblem on his chest. The pixelated nature of the art gives it a unique, retro look, and can be used to create images for video games, wallpapers, or other forms of digital media. The style requires a strong attention to detail and a good understanding of color and form, as the small size of the pixels makes it important to get the details just right.

            <p>The art typically features a colorful and intricate arrangement of stars, clouds of gas and dust, and other celestial objects, often set against a black background to emphasize the beauty and complexity of the galaxy. The pixelated nature of the art gives it a unique, retro look and can be used to create wallpapers, animations, or other forms of digital media. The style requires a good eye for color and composition, as well as a strong attention to detail, as even the smallest pixels can have a big impact on the overall appearance of the image.

The city may be depicted as bustling and alive with activity, or as a desolate and eerie place, depending on the artist's vision and intent. The pixelated nature of the art gives it a unique, retro look, and can be used to create images for video games, wallpapers, or other forms of digital media. The style requires a strong attention to detail and a good understanding of perspective and design principles, as well as an imaginative vision for what a futuristic city might look like.
